1,"Communik8 is the worst company ever – I waited 45 minutes for my call to be answered and the customer service was useless!"
2,"My handset took two weeks to arrive, not the promised 48 hours, so I cancelled my order."
3,"Coverage in my area is rubbish. I can’t make or receive calls, and the mobile internet connection is very patchy."
4,"The staff at the Riverside store are incredibly rude. I needed help with my handset, and they laughed at me."
5,"The website is a joke, and the only way to ask questions is through the chat. The responses are irrelevant and ungrammatical!"
6,"Avoid at all costs!"
7,"I’m still waiting for a response to the complaint email I sent a month ago. Going to cancel, been a loyal customer for 10 years."
8,"I was charged twice in one month and got a debt collector’s letter when I refused to pay the bill."
9,"I tried to cancel within the 14-day cooling-off period and was told it would happen automatically. It didn’t, now I’m tied into an unwanted 24-month contract."
